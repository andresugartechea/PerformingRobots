### The Debate of Silicon Valley

Inspired by the historical Valladolid Debate, this play unfolds in a courtroom, where human lawyers and AI advocates engage in a legal dispute to determine whether robots or not are deserving of human rights.

The trial brings into focus the concept of humanity, with input from philosophers and scientists who contribute their distinct viewpoints. They employ their respective definitions to assess the humanity of robots, considering aspects such as their capability to experience emotions, possess consciousness, and exercise free will.

The narrative reaches a turning point when one of the robots runs out of power, leading to a collective display of distress among the other robots. This expression of fear of "death" serves as a compelling illustration of their capacity to connect with human emotions, ultimately influencing the verdict in their favor, thereby granting them rights.
